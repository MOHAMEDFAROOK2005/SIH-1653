## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
1. Virtual Boardroom Interface with AI-Powered Interview Simulation:
Develop a realistic virtual boardroom environment where interviewers and candidates interact.
Use AI-driven question selection based on the applicant’s expertise and job role.
2. Intelligent Question Matching and Evaluation System:
Expert Panel Question Bank: Store categorized questions based on domains, expertise levels, and job roles.
Automated Question Matching: The system should analyze the candidate’s profile and suggest the most relevant questions.
Scoring Mechanism for Experts: Experts can rate how relevant a question is to the candidate’s expertise, ensuring a fair evaluation.
3. AI-Powered Response Assessment:
Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) & AI to evaluate candidate responses in real-time.
The system will compare responses with model answers and use sentiment analysis to assess confidence.
Experts can also manually override AI ratings to ensure fairness.
4. Quantifiable Scoring & Analytics Dashboard
Generate individual scores for each candidate based on:
Relevancy of responses to questions
Depth of technical knowledge
Communication skills
Overall interview performance
Provide real-time analytics dashboards for interviewers to compare candidates and make informed hiring decisions.
5. Secure & Scalable Cloud-Based Architecture:
Develop a cloud-hosted web application with role-based access for experts, candidates, and administrators.
Ensure data encryption and secure login to maintain confidentiality.
Enable scalability to accommodate high traffic during peak hiring seasons.
